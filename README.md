# TextGeneration-Input-Image
This web application enables users to upload images (e.g., invoices, receipts, documents, etc.) and uses **Google Gemini AI** to analyze and extract valuable information from the uploaded image. The application is built with **Streamlit** for an intuitive web interface and leverages **Pillow (PIL)** for image handling. The core functionality is powered by **Google Gemini AI**, which processes the image content and provides meaningful insights based on a defined input prompt.

## Key Features:
- **Image Upload**: Supports image file uploads in **JPG**, **PNG**, or **JPEG** formats.
- **Image Analysis with Gemini AI**: Extracts information from uploaded images using **Google Gemini AI** and generates meaningful responses.
